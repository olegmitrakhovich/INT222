	<p class = "type1">
	I am currently a student at Seneca College and enrolled in a Computer Programming and Analysis program. I decided to take the CPA program, because of its vast opportunity in the IT industry. I believe 
	that the IT field is very exciting to work in, due to it's always changing environments and new opportunities.</p> 
	<p class = "type1">
	I am confident that I will be successful in this field, because I do have life experience behind me already. I worked in many other industries such as the Military, Security and Customer service; before taking this 
	program. My military experience instilled enough discipline in me, to be ready for any challenge that the programming field throws at me. I learned a lot about the legal side of the world from working in the security industry. I learned and 
	understood the steps that need to be taking to protect data legally and physically if needed. In the Customer service field, I gained enough experience in working with people, as well communicating with them. I personally 
	think that communication in the IT world is key.  Considering that most projects are built in a team environment, I can bring a lot to the table when it comes to team building and relationships.</p>
	<p class = "type1">
	My main goal for this program is to get into co-op, where I would like to gain enough experience to be ready for the real world. I looked into companies of interest: UXP systems, Exchange Solutions and 
	Leonardo Worldwide Corp., are the companies that I would like to apply to, during my co-op period. Once out of school and with enough IT experience under my belt, my goal is to work for a Bank. There are many banks to 
	choose from in Canada, I would still have to my research about the right one. Ultimately I would like to be a Program Manager; such position requires a large company or any major Bank. My second choice would be a Product 
	Manager, there is a higher chance of landing this position since there are a lot more of them, and almost every IT company carries this position.</p>
	<p class = "type1">
	Over all, my goals and aspirations will be accomplished if I start off on a more technical side of the industry. I am excited for future classes that will teach me about Java Development and Mobile Development.  If I 
	master the Java Development and Mobile Development area of expertise, it would be a large step to achieving my goals.
